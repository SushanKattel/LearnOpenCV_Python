Mathematically, circle = (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2
where, (h,k) is the center of the circle, and r is the radius of the circle.

image = 8 bit, single channel, grayscale input image.
circles = Output vectors of found circles.
Method = Detection Method, See HoughModes. Currently, the only implemented method is HOUGH_GRADIENT.
dp = Inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution to image resolution. When dp = 1, accumulator has same 
     resolution as the input image and if dp = 2, the accumulator has half as weak as the width and the height
minDist = minimum distance between the centers of the detected circles.
param1 = First method specific parameter. In case of HOUGH_GRADIENT, it is the higher threshold of the two
         passed to the canny edge detector (the lower one is twice smaller).
param2 = Second method specific parameter. In case of HOUGH_GRADIENT, it is the accumulator threshold for 
         the circle centers at the detection stage.
minRadius = Minimum circle radius.
maxRadius = Maximum circle radius. if <= 0, uses the maximum image dimension. If <0, returns centers without 
            finding the radius.
